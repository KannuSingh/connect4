# Connect 4 Game - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements and specifications for a modern, web-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game. The game provides a single-player experience where users play against a CPU opponent.

### 1.2 Product Overview
Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of the same color.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Casual gamers looking for a quick and engaging experience
- Users of all ages who enjoy classic board games
- People looking for simple browser-based games

## 2. Current Features

### 2.1 Home Screen
- Welcome page with minimal UI
- Player name input field (max 15 characters)
- "Play vs CPU" button that starts a game against a computer opponent
- Visual elements showing the classic red and yellow game pieces

### 2.2 Game Board
- 6x7 grid (6 rows, 7 columns) classic Connect 4 layout
- Visual distinction between player (red) and CPU (yellow) pieces
- Column highlighting on hover for player moves
- Turn-based gameplay alternating between player and CPU

### 2.3 Game Controls
- Menu button to pause the game
- Restart button to reset the current game
- Quit option to return to the home screen

### 2.4 Game Mechanics
- Turn timer (10 seconds per turn)
- Auto-switch to the next player when time runs out
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections
- Draw detection when the board is full
- Score tracking for both player and CPU
- CPU makes random valid moves after a short "thinking" delay
  - CPU move is triggered when board state changes after user's move (dependency fixed)
  - Enhanced implementation with direct state management to prevent timing issues
  - Simple random selection from available valid columns
  - Proper error handling and logging for debugging
  - Memoized game functions to improve performance

### 2.5 UI Elements
- Player and CPU score displays
- Current turn indicator
- Countdown timer display
- Pause menu with continue, restart, and quit options
- Win announcement dialog
- Modern, responsive design with animations

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Architecture
- Built with Next.js and React
- Client-side rendering for game logic
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern component-based architecture

### 3.2 UI/UX
- Responsive design adaptable to different screen sizes
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn UI components
- Custom animations for game pieces
- Color scheme with branded red and yellow accent colors

### 3.3 Data Management
- Local state management using React hooks
- Player name persistence using localStorage
- No backend or database requirements in the current implementation

## 4. Future Feature Roadmap

### 4.1 Gameplay Enhancements
- Multiple difficulty levels for CPU opponent
- Advanced CPU AI using minimax algorithm
- Two-player local multiplayer mode
- Time control options (different timer durations)
- Custom board sizes

### 4.2 User Experience
- Sound effects and background music
- Animated tutorials for new players
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Accessibility improvements
- Responsive design optimization for mobile devices

### 4.3 Online Features
- User accounts and authentication
- Online multiplayer with matchmaking
- Leaderboards and statistics
- Achievements and rewards system
- Spectator mode for online games

### 4.4 Monetization Opportunities
- Custom themes and visual styles
- Premium game modes
- Ad-free experience option
- Tournament mode for competitive play

## 5. Technical Debt and Improvements

### 5.1 Code Structure
- Separate game logic from UI components
- Create custom hooks for game state management
- Implement state management library for complex state
- Add comprehensive test coverage

### 5.2 Performance Optimizations
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize for mobile performance

### 5.3 Security Considerations
- Input validation for player names
- Protection against timing attacks in multiplayer scenarios
- Secure storage of user data (when implemented)

## 6. Success Metrics

### 6.1 User Engagement
- Session duration
- Number of games played per session
- Return rate

### 6.2 Technical Performance
- Load time metrics
- Animation smoothness
- Responsiveness on different devices

## 7. Timeline and Priorities

### 7.1 High Priority
- Fix any existing bugs in win detection
- Improve CPU AI strategy
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

### 7.2 Medium Priority
- Add difficulty levels
- Implement sound effects
- Add animation improvements

### 7.3 Low Priority
- Implement online multiplayer
- Add user accounts
- Create leaderboards

## 8. Conclusion

The Connect 4 game provides a solid foundation for a classic board game implementation with modern web technologies. The current version delivers a functional single-player experience against a CPU opponent with core game mechanics implemented. Future development should focus on enhancing the CPU AI, adding multiplayer capabilities, and improving overall user experience.
